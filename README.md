### Hi, I'm Luca.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on software dev, designing apps, and experimenting with machine learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about machine learning/deep learning/neural networks and computer vision.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on TSA competitions in the coming months, like VG dev and app dev.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my favorite jazz music. Or don't. Talking to me might prove awkward.

- âš¡ Over the years music has turned from an easy class into a small side hobby into an obsession. I'm currently learning clarinet, soprano sax, and harmonica on top of my existing tenor sax and piano. Want to listen to a piece I wrote?
