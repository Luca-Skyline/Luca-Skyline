### Hi, I'm Luca. ðŸ‘‹

Junior (class of 2025) at Skyline High School in SLC, UT

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on software dev, designing apps, and experimenting with machine learning. I'm also composing music and writing a novel. Plus, I'm in Kapptie's robotics class at Skyline High!
    (If that's not enough I'm doing IB and in something like 8 clubs and president of 3 of them ðŸ« . Yea. It's a lot.)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about machine learning/deep learning/neural networks and computer vision.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on TSA (and FBLA?) coding competitions in the coming months, like VG dev and app dev.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my favorite jazz music or science fiction novels.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [email me](mailto:lucadalcanto7@gmail.com) or DM me on discord (jazzberry.jam). I can also be found at pretty much any tech/science clubs after school (and am probably on the team running those clubs).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- ðŸ¤” Personality Type: INTJ. Yes, I'm a big-time introvert, but there's still lots of people I enjoy talking to if we share hobbies!
- âš¡ Among my other hobbies, I love composing music. You can listen to a short orchestral piece I wrote [here](https://musescore.com/user/40316551/scores/11059336)!
