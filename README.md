- ⚡ Fun Fact: among my other hobbies, I love composing music. I'm not an expert (pretty much self taught), but you can listen to a short orchestral piece I wrote [here](https://musescore.com/user/40316551/scores/11059336)!

- 💻 You should join TSA (The Technology Student Association). We have competitions ranging from programming to music production, fashion design to robotics, CAD to debate. Skyline TSA meets on Thursdays. [How to start a TSA chapter at your own high school.](https://tsaweb.org/students/join-tsa)
