### Hi, I'm Luca. ðŸ‘‹

Senior (class of 2025) at Skyline High School in SLC, UT
 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working here and there on software dev, designing apps, and experimenting a tiny bit with machine learning. I also have an internship with the engineering college and the Energy and Geoscience Institute at the U of U.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about machine learning/deep learning/neural networks and computer vision. ðŸ‘€

- âš¡ Fun Fact: among my other hobbies, I love composing music. I'm not an expert (pretty much self taught), but you can listen to a short orchestral piece I wrote [here](https://musescore.com/user/40316551/scores/11059336)!

- ðŸ’» You should join TSA (The Technology Student Association). We have competitions ranging from programming to music production, fashion design to robotics, CAD to debate. Skyline TSA meets on Thursdays. [How to start a TSA chapter at your own high school.](https://tsaweb.org/membership/information/interested-in-starting-a-tsa-chapter)
