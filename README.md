### Hi, I'm Luca. And in case you're wondering how I'm doing, it's tired. And so ready to be done with this dang month.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on random little stuff for class. I'm tired from TSA state and not doing much programming or collaborating right now.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ mostly.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing right now, but would love to help out if I can.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my favorite jazz music. Or don't. Talking to me might prove awkward.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: lucadalcanto7@gmail.com or on discord (Luca D #4940)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Why is it so hard to find real facts other than the fun ones? Truth is like a needle in a needlestack of misinformation and lies.
