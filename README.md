### Hi, I'm Luca. ðŸ‘‹

If you bother to read all this, you are a rare person to be found on this Earth.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on software dev, designing apps, and experimenting with machine learning. I'm also composing music and writing a novel. Plus, I'm in Kapptie's robotics class at Skyline High!
    (If that's not enough I'm doing IB and in something like 8 clubs and president of 3 of them ðŸ« . Yea. It's a lot.)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about machine learning/deep learning/neural networks and computer vision.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on TSA competitions in the coming months, like VG dev and app dev.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my favorite jazz music. One of the better ways to talk to me without it proving awkward.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [email me](mailto:lucadalcanto7@gmail.com) or DM me on discord (jazzberry.jam). I can also be found at pretty much any tech/science clubs after school (and am probably on the team running those clubs) so yea.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- ðŸ¤” Personality Type: INTJ. Yes, I'm a big-time introvert. But there's still people I enjoy talking to... if someone starts a conversation...
- âš¡ Among my other hobbies, I love composing music. You can listen to a short orchestral piece I wrote [here](https://musescore.com/user/40316551/scores/11059336)!
