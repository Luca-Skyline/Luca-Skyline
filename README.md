### Hi, I'm Luca. 👋

Junior (class of 2025) at Skyline High School in SLC, UT

- 🔭 I’m currently working here and there on software dev, designing apps, and experimenting a tiny bit with machine learning. 😬
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about machine learning/deep learning/neural networks and computer vision. 👀
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on TSA (and FBLA?) coding competitions in the coming months, like VG dev and app dev.
- 💬 Ask me about my favorite jazz music or science fiction novels.
- 📫 How to reach me: stopping by a STEM club is usually a safe bet :) 
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun Fact: among my other hobbies, I love composing music. I'm not very good, but you can listen to a short orchestral piece I wrote [here](https://musescore.com/user/40316551/scores/11059336)!
