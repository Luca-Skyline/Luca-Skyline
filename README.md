### Hi, I'm Luca.

And in case you're wondering how I'm doing, it's pretty good, I guess.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on NEDC stuff - getting ready for state.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ mostly, also Arduino.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing right now, but would love to help out if I can.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my favorite jazz music. Or don't. Talking to me might prove awkward.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: lucadalcanto7@gmail.com or on discord (Luca D #4940)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Over the years music has turned from an easy class into a small side hobby into an obsession. I'm currently learning clarinet, soprano sax, and harmonica on top of my existing tenor sax and piano. Want to listen to something I wrote?
